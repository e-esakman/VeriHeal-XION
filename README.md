üß†What is VeriHeal?
VeriHeal is a privacy-preserving health-tech app that empowers individuals to access subsidized, 
stigma-free, or insurance-backed healthcare without compromising their identity or sensitive medical history.

## Project Aim to solve -

While exploring health access challenges, I came across numerous stories and studies 
showing how **insurance systems often fail the most vulnerable** ‚Äî not due to lack of policies, but due to **discrimination, lack of privacy, or systemic bias**.

- **Elderly patients** are often misled or exploited due to their lack of familiarity / education with insurance terms or digital systems.   
- **LGBTQ+ individuals** report being excluded from insurance or facing biased treatment due to their identity.
- **People with chronic or genetic pre-existing illnesses** struggle to access fair treatment or insurance coverage due to biased algorithms or outdated policies.

### How VeriHeal Helps

1. **Selective Disclosure:**
    Users prove eligibility (e.g., ‚ÄúIn Recovery/Suffering from so & so‚Äù) without exposing full medical records & enabling support without stigma.
2. **Trustworthy Proofs for Aid:** 
    NGOs, gov programs, or alt-insurers can verify someone's health journey via badges, not invasive data.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Access:**
    VeriHeal replaces ‚Äúprove your illness‚Äù with ‚Äúprove your effort‚Äù , encouraging care-seeking while protecting identity.
4. **Web3-Ready Future:**
    Badges can plug into decentralized health insurance, DAOs, and ZK claim systems unlocking new care models.
    Users can **opt-in anonymously.**

 WORKING OF THE PROJECT
-**For CHECKPOINT 1
     -UI design of the App, requires a bit of polishing
     -Created Stimulation of XION DAVE TOOLKIT, zKTLS & On-chain badges Hash code
     -Due to short time, i published the app mockup build on Expo
     
- **Short-Term (Checkpoint 2)**:
    - Add Supabase backend for login, user data, and badges.
    - Replace simulated XION Dave Toolkit integration with real SDK.
    - Add placeholder for ZK backend connection.
 
  - **Long-Term (Checkpoint 3)**:
    - Real on-chain ZK proof verification using ZK Oracles.
    - Mint privacy-respecting NFTs or on-chain badges.
    - Enable NGO/DAO simulation to validate badges and issue aid/subsidies
